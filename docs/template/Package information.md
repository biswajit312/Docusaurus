Package Information Document

1.	Tool Name:  Sonarqube
2.	Tool Introduction: 
    SonarQube is a free and open-source tool for analysing and reporting code quality. It analyses your source code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and maintainability concerns, then generates a report that allows you to spot potential problems in your programme. 
3.	The value it brings:
  - Issues Identification: -
        a)	Detect Bugs : SonarQube  can spot complex issues and flag incorrect code.
        b)	Code Smells : Code smells are features of a code that signal that the programme may cause a problem in the future.
        c)	Security Vulnerability : SonarQube is capable of detecting security flaws in code.
        d)	Activate Rules Needed : Quality Profiles are a type of rule set that may be created and maintained for specific projects. This implies that a group or initiative must adhere to a set of guidelines. We can then use SonarQube to generate a Quality profile.
